# Advent of Code

This repository contains solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles, written in TypeScript and run using Deno.

## Usage

To run these solutions, you will need to have Deno installed.

To run a solution for a specific puzzle, use the `deno task run` command followed by the **year** and **day** of the puzzle. For example, to run the solution for puzzle 1 of day 1 in 2022, run the following command:

```bash
deno task run 2022 01
```

To run the tests for a solution, use the `--test` flag with the deno task run command. For example, to run the tests for puzzle 1 of day 1, run the following command:

```bash
deno task run 2022 01 --test
```

Note that the input for the puzzles is already provided and does not need to be entered manually.
