# Advent of Code

Hello. This is all my code for "all" the Advent of Code challenges. It is all writtin in TypeScript with Deno, because I love that. I tried to do it in Rust twice but I gave up after 10 minutes on the first day, both times.

I don't know why anyone else would like to run this code. But if you do, and you're not stupid. Do the following:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install Deno
3. Run the code

Simple as that. I'm not going to tell you how to clone the repository or how to install Deno. If you don't know how to do that, you're not that smart, and don't belong on GitHub.

I am going to tell you how to run the code though, because I'm nice like that.

There is a special task in the `deno.json` file where I made a script that runs the code for you. You can pass `--test` to run the example input.

```sh
deno task run <year> <day> [--test]
```

I also made a `download` script that downloads the input from the current day for you. You have to have a session cookie like this in a `.env` file:

```env
AOC_SESSION=joemama
```

Then you can run the script like this:

```sh
deno task download
```

If you are stealing my template. You can generate all the necessary files for a new day by running:

```sh
deno task g
```

Okay thanks bye <3
